If a parameter has a typical unit that is used throughout your report, then it should be included here on the right hand side.

If you have a very mathematical report, then you may wish to divide the nomenclature list into functions and variables, and then sub- and super-scripts.

Note that Roman mathematical symbols are typically in a serif font in italics.
