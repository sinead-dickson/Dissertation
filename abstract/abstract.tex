This dissertation proposes a method of incorporating the sentiment of review-like tweets into a recommender system. This research aims to evaluate to what extent Twitter can provide a suitable source of online reviews that can be used effectively in the generation of recommendations in a recommender system. 

With the increasing amount of information available on the internet, recommender systems are growing in importance. Recommender systems help users to overcome information overload. They help users to quickly find relevant information.

%Online reviews are everywhere...

Twitter is a widely used microblogging social media platform. It has 126 million people who used the site daily and 500 million tweets posted per day. These tweets can often take the form of a review. This project will focus on harnessing these reviews and using them to improve the recommendations of a recommender system.

We explore the use of various classification algorithms and feature representations to first classify which tweets contain reviews. The sentiment of these review-like tweets is calculated and used to re-rank the CoRE recommender system.

The classification results were promising. The Support Vector Machine Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 74.4\%.
