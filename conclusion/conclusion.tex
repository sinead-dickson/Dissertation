\section{Summary of Results}

\subsection*{Limitations}

The size of our dataset is a major limiting factor. Although the results are promising we cannot claim that this method performs well without evaluating it on a larger dataset.

\section{Future Work}
One line of future work would be to improve the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. This could be achieved by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increasing the size of the dataset. In general, supervised machine learning methods perform better on large datasets. This would involve gathering more tweets and manually annotating them.
    \item Investigating other feature representations. Part-of-speech tagging and natural language processing techniques could be experimented with.
    \item Trying more classification algorithms. Algorithms such as fakshfksj which were not evaluated in this research could be investigated. 
\end{itemize}

This research focused on hotels in Dublin. This scope could be expanded first geographically and then to different fields. Twitter could be used to gain sentiment information about restaurants, movies etc. and applied to recommender systems relating to these fields.

The Stanford NLP Sentiment Analyser was trained on a set of movie reviews from rotten tomatoes. It would be interesting to evaluate whether re-training the analyser using review-like tweets would improve it's performance. 

More data could be collected to evaluate the recommender system.

Prioritising more recent reviews.
